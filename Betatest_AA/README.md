### Information
### Hallo Users,

This a Project from Group Adrette Apparate. It is part of University Ludwig Maximilian University software development internship program.

 ### Launch and play our version of "RoboRally
 To start the JAR File:

 To start the Server: 
 java -jar adrette-apparate-server.jar

 To start the Client:
 java -jar adrette-apparate-client.jar

 So an example of the IP and Port Combination options would be:
 
- Combination 1 = IP: sep21.dbs.ifi.lmu.de Port: 52021
- Combination 2 = IP: 127.0.0.1 Port: 3232

First you have to start the server and then the client. 
When you run client then a Connection window opens where you can enter IP and port, after you entered IP and port you can log in as AI or press Connect button and log in as nonAI player. (At the moment it works only on the test server of the university and only nonAI players).
We are in the process of fixing the bugs we got. 

You may need to edit your configurations, 

So an example of the VM options would be: 
--module-path
/home/kishan/Downloads/openjfx-16_linux-x64_bin-sdk/javafx-sdk-16/lib
--add-modules=javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
--add-opens
javafx.graphics/javafx.scene.text=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens
javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.text=ALL-UNNAMED

Thank you
